SimpleLauncher_NoAds - Source project (minimal)
----------------------------------------------
What you get:
- Full Android Studio project source (Kotlin) for a lightweight launcher
- No ad SDKs included
- No iPhone-style control center included
- Simple search + app grid + launch functionality

How to build:
1. Download and unzip the project.
2. Open Android Studio -> Open an existing project -> select the unzipped folder.
3. Let Gradle sync. Make sure you have Android SDK for compileSdk 34 and Kotlin configured.
4. Build -> Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) -> Build APK(s).
5. Install produced APK on your phone and set it as Home (launcher).

Notes:
- If you want, I can build a signed APK for you and send it; to do that I'd need to perform a build on a machine.
- You can request more features (themes, hide apps, app lock, widgets host) and I'll update the source.
